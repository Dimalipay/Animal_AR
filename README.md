# Animal_AR

Hi, my name is @Dimalipay ðŸ‘€ . My first application is based on the Unity3D game engine and in C#, using the ARCore augmented reality library.

In this project, you can familiarize yourself with the main functionality of the application (the start button), as well as take a quiz.

On this screen you can sort the cards with animals by their habitat. Clicking on the card with the animal goes to the next screen.

Here is information about the selected animal, which you can scroll through. There are also buttons to go to the documentary and the ability to view an animal model using AR technology.

After determining the placement plane, an animal model appears in front of you. At the top of the screen you have 2 buttons, reloading the model and returning to the information. The animal can be scaled (bringing together and spreading fingers on the screen) and rotate.
